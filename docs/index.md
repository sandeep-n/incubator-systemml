SystemML is now an **Apache Incubator** project! Please see the [**Apache SystemML (incubating)**](http://systemml.apache.org/)
website for more information.

SystemML is a flexible, scalable machine learning system.
SystemML's distinguishing characteristics are:

  1. **Algorithm customizability via R-like and Python-like languages**.
  2. **Multiple execution modes**, including Spark MLContext, Spark Batch, Hadoop Batch, Standalone, and JMLC.
  3. **Automatic optimization** based on data and cluster characteristics to ensure both efficiency and scalability.

The [**SystemML GitHub README**](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml) describes
building, testing, and running SystemML. Please read [**Contributing to SystemML**](contributing-to-systemml)
to find out how to help make SystemML even better!

To download SystemML, visit the [downloads](http://systemml.apache.org/download) page.


## Running SystemML

* **[Spark MLContext](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide)** - Spark MLContext is a programmatic API
for running SystemML from Spark via Scala, Python, or Java.
  * See the [Spark MLContext Programming Guide](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide) with the
  following examples:
    * [**Spark Shell (Scala)**](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide#spark-shell-example---new-api)
    * [**Zeppelin Notebook (Scala)**](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide#zeppelin-notebook-example---linear-regression-algorithm---old-api)
    * [**Jupyter Notebook (PySpark)**](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide#jupyter-pyspark-notebook-example---poisson-nonnegative-matrix-factorization---old-api)
* **[Spark Batch](spark-batch-mode)** - Algorithms are automatically optimized to run across Spark clusters.
  * See [Invoking SystemML in Spark Batch Mode](spark-batch-mode) for detailed information.
* **[Hadoop Batch](hadoop-batch-mode)** - Algorithms are automatically optimized when distributed across Hadoop clusters.
  * See [Invoking SystemML in Hadoop Batch Mode](hadoop-batch-mode) for detailed information.
* **[Standalone](standalone-guide)** - Standalone mode allows data scientists to rapidly prototype algorithms on a single
machine in R-like and Python-like declarative languages.
  * The [Standalone Guide](standalone-guide) provides examples of algorithm execution
  in Standalone Mode.
* **[JMLC](jmlc)** - Java Machine Learning Connector.
  * See [Java Machine Learning Connector (JMLC)](jmlc) for more information.

## Language Guides

* [DML Language Reference](dml-language-reference) -
DML is a high-level R-like declarative language for machine learning.
* **PyDML Language Reference** **(Coming Soon)** -
PyDML is a high-level Python-like declarative language for machine learning.
* [Beginner's Guide to DML and PyDML](beginners-guide-to-dml-and-pydml) -
An introduction to the basics of DML and PyDML.
* [Beginner's Guide for Python users](beginners-guide-python) -
